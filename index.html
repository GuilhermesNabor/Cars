    <p>It was only in 1993 that the fourth generation Supra was launched. In this model, the retractable headlights were removed and the car gained a much more resistant and more rounded body than the previous ones. Weight reduction was extremely important for this model, losing almost 60 kg (132 lb) over the previous generation, thanks to the use of aluminum in the hood, roof and bumper brackets. With this generation comes more technology and more novelties for those who are passionate about the car. This time two engine options, one with 6 cylinders (2JZ-GE), 3.0 liters and 24 valves with dual overhead camshafts and variable valve opening control, responsible for 220 horsepower, and another (2JZ-GTE ) with the same characteristics, but with two sequenced turbos that yielded up to 325 horsepower. Equipped with a Getrag 6-speed manual transmission, the Supra biturbo exported to countries that do not require an electronic speed limiter, reaches 250 km/h (with the electronic limiter it reaches 180 km/h) and accelerates from 0-100 km /h in 5.3 seconds. However, in several European countries and even in the USA - a large market for the Supra - the pollutant emission regulations imposed restrictions on cars like it and some of its competitors, causing its sales to be closed in 1999. Production continued in Japan until August 2002, ceasing due to restrictive emission standards.
